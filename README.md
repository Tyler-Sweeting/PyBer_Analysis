# PyBer_Analysis

###Overview of the Analysis:
The Purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. With this summary DataFrame we are to create a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type.

###Results:
As you can see from the above DataFrame, urban cities have many more drivers and rides than suburban and rural cities. Urban cities have around twice the amount of fares than suburban cities and around 8 times the amount of fares than rural cities. But, due to the large quantity of drivers in urban cities, the average fare per driver is quite larger in suburban cities and even larger in rual cities. 

The Above line graph shows the total weekly fares for each city type. As you can see January is a slowe month, most likely due to being in the middle of winter and right after christmas so people are not going out as much. There is then a gradual iincrease in fares as the months go on until around spring time when people are probably more likely to walk or bike as the weather gets warmer. The first week of April and last weekn of February are nice spikes for PyBer.

###Summary:
Based on the results, there are a few business reccomendations I can make. Firstly, I would increase the number of drivers in rural areas, as those cities have a higher average fare due to further travel distance being required. Even though the population may be smaller, people require longer rides. Secondly, the average fare per driver in urban areas is pretty low. To fix that, I would lower the amount of drivers we have in urban areas, but not by to much as we would not want to raise wait times for customers waiting for a driver. Finally, I notice that on holidays our fares don't spike as much as they should, we should increase marketing during those times to promote using our service to avoid drinking and driving during a holiday weekend.
